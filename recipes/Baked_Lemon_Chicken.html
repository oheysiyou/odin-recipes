    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A great chicken recipe that I have made for years. Serve with rice and a fresh veggie. Impressive!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>3 cups fresh sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pour olive oil in an 8x8-inch glass baking dish. Place 
            the chicken breasts in the dish, coating each side with oil. 
            Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon over each chicken breast. 
            Slice the rest of the lemon and place a lemon slice on top of 
            each chicken piece.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center 
            and the juices run clear, 30 to 40 minutes. An instant-read 
            thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 
            degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; add mushrooms. 
            Cook and stir until mushrooms are brown and liquid is 
            evaporated, about 6 minutes. Sprinkle flour over mushrooms 
            and stir until coated. Add chicken broth, stirring to make a 
            medium-thick sauce. Allow sauce to reduce, adjusting with a 
            little more broth to make a creamy sauce. Add fresh parsley 
            at the last minute. Spoon the sauce over the baked chicken 
            breasts.</li>
    </ol>
